# Fake_Real_News

Is this news real? Is it fake? What about the title -- is it clickbait? Our machine learning-driven website shows the power of natural language processing to prevent the deception of people by fake news.

Utilized Scikit-learn for the ML algorithms, re and string to preprocess and clean the text. Pickle was used to dump the models and vectorizers to the flask framework.

Completed as a project for Hacklytics 2022.
